"""Entrypoint for the systemd-timer-driven nightly scrape.

Runs in three steps each tick, each isolated so a failure can't take
out the next:

  1. Document scrape — `run_scraper(historical=True)` across all 13 crawlers.
     Tags the scraper_runs row with triggered_by="schedule".
  2. Borough event calendar — `run_events_scrape()` against
     ahnj.com/Upcoming Events for current month + 12 ahead.
  3. Live-music scrape — `run_music_scrape()` iterates the venue registry
     (Squarespace + WordPress Tribe Events adapters) across Atlantic
     Highlands / Highlands / Sea Bright music venues.

Wire-up on EC2:
  /etc/systemd/system/ah-scraper.service   (oneshot)
  /etc/systemd/system/ah-scraper.timer     (OnCalendar=*-*-* 00:00:00 America/New_York)

The unit files live in infra/systemd/ and are installed via SSM, not by
the application code itself.
