Query expansion for municipal / civic search.

Two layers:

  1. Static synonym dictionary (instant, no network). Captures local Atlantic
     Highlands / HHRSD vocabulary that Postgres' English stemmer can't reach:
       - acronyms ("CAFR" → "comprehensive annual financial report")
       - civic jargon ("redev" → "redevelopment")
       - euphemisms ("trash fees" → "sanitation rates")
     Every key/value pair is normalized lowercase. Look-ups are case-insensitive.

  2. Optional LLM paraphrase via Gemini 2.5-flash. Triggered only when a short
     query (≤3 tokens) doesn't hit the dictionary — long natural-language
     queries don't usually need it. Returns 3 paraphrases. Failure is silent;
     the caller gets back just the original query.

The expansion is intended to be wrapped in an FTS OR query, e.g.
  websearch_to_tsquery('english', 'CAFR OR "comprehensive annual financial report"')
