"""Runner — iterates the venue registry, isolates per-venue failures,
persists results to calendar_events with event_type='live_music'.

Dedupe: existing scrape_events.save_to_db uses (date, title) as the
upsert key. That collides if two venues both have a "Live Music"
generic-titled event on the same night — so the dedupe key here
incorporates the venue name. We hand-roll the insert below to keep
the writer simple and explicit.

On a key hit we refresh time/end_time/ticket_url/description instead of
skipping, so set-time changes and parser fixes reach rows that already
exist. Identity (date/venue/title) is never rewritten — a changed title
is a different event, not an edit.
